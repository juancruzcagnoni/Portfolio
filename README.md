## Juan Cruz Cagnoni, Frontend developer portofolio

Hey there, welcome to my web portfolio! This is where you can get a better understanding of who I am, what skills I have, and the projects I've worked on.

First off, I want to show you what I'm capable of. In the Skills section, you'll get to see all the programming languages and design tools I'm proficient in. From HTML and CSS to Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, I'm always learning and expanding my skill set.

But let's get to the fun stuff! In the Projects section, you can see some of the work I've done in the past and what I'm currently working on. I'm really proud of my projects and hope you find them interesting.

Finally, if you're interested in working together or have any questions for me, please don't hesitate to reach out in the Contact section. I'm always excited about new opportunities and collaborations. Thanks for checking out my portfolio, and I hope to hear from you soon!
